# WTA_AntitheticControl
The MATLAB codes can be useful to reproduce the results of the research article 'Mitigating Winner-Take-All resource competition through antithetic control mechanism'.
We have studied here 6 different cases- system without resource competition (NO-RC), system with resource competition (RC), RC-Open-Loop system, local antithetic controller (LC), global antithetic controller (GC) and negatively competitive regulation (NCR) with antithetic controller mechanism.
