# WTA_AntitheticControl
The MATLAB codes can be useful to reproduce the results of the research article 'Mitigating Winner-Take-All resource competition through antithetic control mechanism'.
We have studied here 6 different cases- system without resource competition (NO-RC), system with resource competition (RC), RC-Open-Loop system, local antithetic controller (LC), global antithetic controller (GC) and negatively competitive regulation (NCR) with antithetic controller mechanism. The required codes, along with the basal parameter sets, are available in the "Basic_Code" folder for these 6 different scenarios.
We have also conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis for both symmetric and asymmetric cases. The codes for the symmetric analysis can be found in the "Global_Symmetric_Sensitivity_Analysis" folder, and the codes for the asymmetric analysis are available in the "Global_Asymmetric_Sensitivity_Analysis" folder.
The codes for the local parameter sensitivity analysis are included in the "Local_Sensitivity_Analysis" folder.
